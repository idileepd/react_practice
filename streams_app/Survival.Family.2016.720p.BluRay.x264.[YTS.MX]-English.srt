00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:48,116
FUJI TELEVISION NETWORK, TOHO,
DENTSU and ALTAMIRA PICTURES present

2
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:57,501
An ALTAMIRA PICTURES production

3
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:07,408
A SHINOBU YAGUCHI Film

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,526
I input the data

5
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,595
This one's next, right away

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,534
Yes, thanks for another package

7
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,866
I catch so many,
I have fish left after I give them away

8
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,136
How have you been? Busy?

9
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,446
You should come home
once in a while to see me

10
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:48,744
I should. I want to visit
Mom's grave, too

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,559
Oh, so disgusting!
From Kagoshima, again?

12
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,952
Yui just got out of the bath

13
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,395
Your grandpa

14
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,229
- No thanks, I won't talk to him
- What? Hey!

15
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,465
Sorry, yeah

16
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,071
Oh, I see Bye,then

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,637
I won't eat that crap

18
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,721
I can't do this

19
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,787
<i>Say, can you do it, please?</i>

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,253
<i>Me? No thanks</i>

21
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,257
Maybe I'll do it tomorrow

22
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,101
We won't eat it, so tell him
to stop sending fish

23
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,534
I can't tell him that

24
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,565
All he cares about is fishing and farming

25
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:55,177
And this thing I know it's organic, but...

26
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,949
Get me rice

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,449
Get it yourself

28
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,989
Oh, I forgot

29
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,570
What! What is it?

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,676
I don't know It looked like this

31
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,512
That's why l hate his packages!

32
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,140
Oh, I gotta go!

33
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,012
Don't put it here!

34
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,916
Oh! There it is!

35
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,662
Don't do that!

36
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,537
Hey! Can't you even greet your family?

37
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,737
Dinner?

38
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,083
You're unbelievable

39
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,616
You've got dinner at home,
but you buy that crap!

40
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,886
Loser

41
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,079
"New Folder 'International Economics"'

"Nakamura Satomi"

44
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,757
Suzuki speaking

45
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,759
Sorry, can you talk?

46
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,863
What? Yeah

47
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,725
I can't hear you well

48
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,792
Oh, sorry

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,768
Did you grab screen shots
of the notes in today's class?

50
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,134
I'm just uploading them now

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,039
Oh, great Can you send it to me?

52
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,304
Sure

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,113
<i>To which address?</i>

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,907
To my PC

55
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,695
I got it, thanks

56
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,623
- See you
- Tomorrow

57
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,234
Great

58
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,403
Why are you filming yourself?

59
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,766
- Why'd you already eat?
- Shut up!

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,943
Let's settle who's buying lunch

61
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,443
She's cute

62
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,000
What a pain!

63
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,371
"Your battery is low"

64
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,685
Stop it

65
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,831
Say, did you take a look?

66
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,293
The children's smart phone bills

67
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,066
You have to tell them, too

68
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,076
Are you listening?

69
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm tired
Tell me tomorrow

70
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,513
I'm going to bed

71
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:05,750


72
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,744
"Day 1"

73
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,391
Hey! What time is it?

74
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,333
I don't know

75
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,301
Why not?

76
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,099
- There's a blackout
- A blackout?

77
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,106
- Why?
- I told you, I don't know

78
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,573
Oh, no

79
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,972
There's no lights, can't watch TV

80
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,978
What a mess

81
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,783
Why are you screaming so early?

82
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,320
It's a blackout!

83
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,081
What's that?

84
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,293
Oh, crap! Move!

85
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,535
Are you checking?

86
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,012
What?

87
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,355
Can't you even do that?

88
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,558
I can't figure it out

89
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,832
No breakfast, right?

90
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,032
The rice hasn't cooked and
the electro-magnetic stove doesn't work

91
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,203
Do you want cold bread?

92
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,502
No way, I'll buy something

93
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,842
Oh, I know

94
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,144
Why do they all stop at once!
You should change the batteries

95
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,011
The number for the time is 117, right?

96
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,881
There's a number for time?

97
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,657
Hey!

98
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,318
What's going on!

99
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,964
No newspaper delivered?

100
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,494
Ouch!

101
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,866
Look, it works

102
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,243
Hopeless. It's stopped

103
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,441
We'll have to take the stairs

104
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,380
What, the whole building is blacked out?

105
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,921
Do they ever inspect it?

106
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,425
Shut up, old man

107
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,191
It's a long way down 10 flights of stairs

108
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,968
Don't be late

109
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:15,648
Due to a blackout, all trains are stopped

110
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm sorry, so sorry

111
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,563
All trains are stopped

112
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:27,301
No one is allowed on the platforms

113
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,368
That's all we know

114
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,940
When will they start?

115
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,202
There are no current plans, please wait

116
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,141
Do you have a proof of delay form?

117
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,046
I need to check

118
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,080
This is closed now

119
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,715
We'll update you with new information
Please wait

120
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,352
- Can we wait on the platform?
- Please wait here

121
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,052
Are they any temporary buses?

122
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,494
Apparently there are no buses yet

123
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,034
We don't know when the trains
will resume, please wait here

124
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,994
What...

125
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,668
Damn

126
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,198
Oh, great

127
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,034
I finally found one

128
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,129
- Can I?
- No, no

129
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,109
It may be the batteries, but none of them will start

130
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,479
What? Can't you help me? I can pay cash

131
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,717
It seems the plugs won't spark

132
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,019
Here it is

133
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,555
That's just plain water
Don't you need battery fluid?

134
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,319
They're basically the same

135
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,488
All right, try it

136
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,363
Oh, it doesn't work

137
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,037
This is when bicycles sure are handy

138
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,118
Good morning

139
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,490
A blackout is so unusual these days

140
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,859
And it's not just this building

141
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,202
Oh, really? That one, too?

142
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,769
All the buildings

143
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,073
- Do any of your lights work?
- They're all still off

144
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,077
Oh, I have to buy candles

145
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,371
Me, too

146
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,646
Power will be back tonight

147
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,443
But maybe not, so I'll go, too

148
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,081
I'll buy some, just in case

149
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,116
Oh, my purse

150
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,598
Oh, no...

151
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,114
Hopeless

152
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,250
It won't open?

153
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,909
It won't open

154
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,418
You're late You live at the next station

155
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,585
The next, next station
What time is it?

156
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,254
Excuse me

157
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:47,167
It's an old building, so all the doors
can only be manually opened from inside

158
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,134
Then we'll break in

159
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:54,176
lf you don't mind, just invoice us later

160
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,510
Nobody can get in unless we do

161
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,148
<i>May l have someone's business card?</i>

162
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,519
Here goes

163
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,657
It's open

164
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,188
Watch where you step

165
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,596
I bet the elevators aren't working

166
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,419
The lights?

167
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,282
- Computers?
- Nope, you?

168
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,328
The server's down

169
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,264
<i>What do we do?</i>

170
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,268
- The other floors?
- I'll check

171
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,334
Hey! We can't work like this

172
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,409
Morning!

173
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,223
We had a blackout

174
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,693
- Your <i>place,too?
- You guys,too?</i>

175
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,421
- What a pain
- A total pain

176
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,224
You're all sweaty

177
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,825
The trains were stopped and I freaked

178
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,370
I rode my mom's dorky bike

179
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,310
It's an electric bike, but it didn't work
It was just so heavy

180
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,243
You're so sweaty

181
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,769
Your teacher, Mochizuki,

182
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,315
can't get here,
so the first period is study hall

183
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,545
Quiet down

184
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,016
Somebody, write "Study Hall"

185
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,556
Study Hall

186
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,763
Morning, the trains are stopped today

187
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,003
No power here, either

188
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,535
How wide is the blackout?

189
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,376
It's probably pretty local
Call your house in Kanagawa and find out

190
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,573
Like I said, it's networking!

191
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,981
- You are an idiot
- Oh, right

192
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,548
Hey, where do you live?

193
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,691
- Hey!
- Ouch! What?

194
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,360
He's hopeless

195
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,997
Um, excuse me

196
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,334
Where's Nakamura...

197
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,998
You mean, Satomi? I haven't seen her yet

198
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,702
What's going on with him?

199
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,970
No idea

200
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,511
What happened, suddenly?

201
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,389
Say, any lunch boxes?

202
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,860
I'm sorry, the bento and the bread
haven't been delivered yet

203
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,462
No rice balls?

204
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,962
Sorry

205
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,535
- I'll buy water
- Yeah

206
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,923
Oh, no

207
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,425
230 Yen

208
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,832
198 Yen

209
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,875
Say, hello

210
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,482
I won't be able to wash clothes
or clean house today

211
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,884
I've given up on today

212
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,412
I can't even cook

213
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,758
This is tonight's dinner

214
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,093
No choice, right?

215
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,463
Makes things so easy

216
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,435
I'm sorry, we can't take credit cards
because of the blackout!

217
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,406
We can only accept cash!

218
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,436
Tell us sooner
I was waiting in line

219
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,118
<i>Useless</i>

220
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,551
Oh, no!

221
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,161
That doesn't work either?

222
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,229
When are the young guys
going to get here?

223
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,904
We don't know how far out
the trains are stopped

224
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,939
They should walk, even part way

225
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,138
But you live at the next station

226
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,476
It's the next, next station

227
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,577
Only part of the file is printed
The rest is stuck in the computer

228
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,621
We can't miss the fiscal report deadline!

229
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,748
That won't happen
It'll get back to normal soon, I guess.

230
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,024
Oh, what a mess

231
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,930
All the other departments
are hopeless, too

232
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,068
The outlets don't work
and the batteries are dead,

233
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,570
and the cars won't start.
That's just crazy

234
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,938
Everything electrical is useless

235
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,569
This isn't just a normal blackout...

236
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,674
We can't do anything until power is restored

237
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,682
Everybody can go home now

238
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,789
What?

239
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,584
That's an order from the top

240
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,790
They want everyone to go home
before it gets dark

241
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,966
What's that about?

242
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,001
Thank you

243
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,181
"Special: 44,800 Yen"

244
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,847
How much is that one?

245
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,118
We're stripping this for parts
It's not for sale

246
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,858
I'll buy this one
Can I ride it now?

247
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,543
Oh, my God!

248
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,016
Are you OK?

249
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,633
Do you have to work at a time like this?

250
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,100
That's exactly why l have to work!

251
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,275
Be careful with that flame

252
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,914
Using the toilet?

253
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,252
It doesn't run very well,
so flush it with the bathwater

254
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,587
Answer your mother!

255
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,628
What is he thinking!

256
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,930
I'm turning off the burner

257
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,079
The toilet, too?
It doesn't use any power

258
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,113
I don't understand this

259
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,145
I'm taking this

260
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,751
Thanks for the food

261
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,827
Things will be back to normal tomorrow

262
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,943
Say, dear!

263
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,725
Done

264
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,735
Ouch!

265
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,335
What a drag

266
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,738
You two, come here

267
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,079
The stars are beautiful

268
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,240
What? Stars?

269
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,928
Why?

270
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,769
Without any city lights,
they look brighter

271
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:50,865
What's that?

272
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,842
That's the Milky Way

273
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,911
What? You mean,

274
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,109
there really is a Milky Way?

275
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,374
Are you an idiot?

276
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,549
This isn't so bad,
once in a while

277
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:23,236
"Day 3"

278
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,511
This is endless

279
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,210
Listen up, everyone

280
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,606
All employees need to wait at home
until the power is restored

281
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,908
Please be careful going home

282
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,511
It could be restored any minute
We'll be delayed in responding

283
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,518
Also,

284
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,623
the building entrance is smashed
so please take your valuables with you

285
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,161
<i>Hey</i>

286
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,870
Aren't you worried about your family?

287
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,872
What?

288
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,908
If you stay here, things will get dangerous

289
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,379
Are you crazy? Of course, we'll be fine

290
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,023
Where are you going?

291
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:55,263
We're going to the mountains to find water
There's a camping ground l know

292
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,344
Hey!

293
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,688
What are you doing!

294
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,356
Hey!

295
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,001
"Welcome to Saitama Prefecture"

296
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,290
What?

297
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,063
"Nakamura Satomi 5-3-6 Kawaguchi"

298
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,535
You might be right

299
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,644
- This is really heavy
- Get it together

300
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,612
Let's go

301
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,960
Other prefectures?

302
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,760
We need food,
I'll try the supermarket...

303
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,208
- Oh, hello
- Hello

304
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,148
I've been waiting here two hours

305
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,252
My feet are so cold

306
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,423
Do you have gas at your place?

307
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,493
We cook with electro-magnetic

308
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,057
There's no gas, either?

309
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,356
Do gas meters run on batteries?

310
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,329
My husband said the meter wasn't
working and tried to fix it,

311
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,467
but there's no gas

312
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,537
Excuse us, everyone!

313
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:24,008
The situation is that
there is water underground

314
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,013
Then give us the water!

315
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,541
However, the entire operation
is shut down

316
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,718
so the pumps can't pump water

317
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,148
After making us wait this long!

318
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,486
Go underground and bring up the water!

319
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,559
You guys get the water!

320
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,829
It's not water for drinking, but
there's a well in the park...

321
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,295
We're here to get water to drink!

322
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,404
That's right!

323
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,067
Give us drinking water!

324
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:10,124
You cannot withdraw cash
with ATM or debit cards

325
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,226
You must have identification,

326
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,063
your personal seal and bank passbook

327
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,760
Each person can only withdraw 100,000 Yen in cash!

328
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,430
Don't push! Don't push!

329
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,072
Don't push! Wait your turn!

330
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:13,117
"Day 7"

331
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:24,133
"Study at home until we contact you"

332
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,232
I heard they're distributing
emergency food in Saitama

333
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,431
I went there, but they ran out
a longtime ago

334
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,271
They only gave me
a small bottle of water

335
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,278
What I want to know is,
what's causing this?

336
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,282
It's a natural disaster,
a natural disaster

337
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,715
Our only choice is to gather
all our food and water

338
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,788
and share it all

339
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,823
That won't last a month

340
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,191
We should all move away

341
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,297
What if you've got nowhere to go?

342
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,326
Look, over there!

343
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,330
Don't bother coming back!

344
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,342
If all the apartments empty out,

345
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,502
they'll get looted by those idiots

346
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,616
They belong to all of us,
so we all have to protect them, right?

347
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,208
<i>No, no you stay inside</i>

348
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,913
I'm sorry

349
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,551
Do you know Kato san
who lives above us?

350
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,622
The old lady who lives alone?

351
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,791
I saw her on the steps before Why?

352
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,695
She wasn't at that meeting

353
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,836
I haven't seen her in days

354
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,264
What! Kagoshima!
You mean to Grandpa's house?

355
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,495
If we wait a little longer,
the power will return

356
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,432
You're so useless

357
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,735
It's been like this for a week

358
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,673
Don't you see that if it doesn't come back
we can only survive for so long?

359
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,972
That may be true,
but why Kagoshima?

360
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,972
All my hometown family is dead

361
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,308
It's a lot warmer in Kagoshima

362
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,616
and we'll be able to find
water and food

363
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,983
<i>But how?</i>

364
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,451
A plane from Haneda Airport

365
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,614
If they're flying...

366
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,488
I hate that stupid village

367
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,288
Why?

368
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,365
You visited when you were little

369
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:15,334
You played with Grandpa
on the beach nearby

370
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,006
What? I don't remember that

371
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,407
Oh, how do we get to Haneda?

372
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,535
On bicycles

373
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,535
It's straight down the main road

374
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,703
No way!
For real!

375
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,511
Leave everything to me!
Follow me and you'll be fine

376
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,012
Why Kagoshima!

377
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,825
I told them I don't want to go

378
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,957
I'll take both

379
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,417
ls this enough,
to buy us all plane tickets?

380
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,822
Can you buy discount tickets
at the airport?

381
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,352
Well, um...

382
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:18,690
I saved this money for an emergency

383
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,040
It's sunscreen, put it on

384
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,579
Isn't this great?

385
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,826
Are you still carrying this
like some treasure?

386
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,460
Yuck

387
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,603
And look at how you're dressed

388
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,437
Who wears false eyelashes, now?

389
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,175
OK!

390
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,753
Hang in there!

391
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,581
We haven't been cycling in a while

392
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,480
We went with the children's group

393
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,589
That's ancient history

394
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,651
Did we go?

395
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,626
You slept through your days off

396
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,289
You never came on
any of those outings

397
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:38,832
OK, 2,000 Yen
Thanks, next

398
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,877
Step right up
One bottle of water for 1,000 Yen

399
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,918
How about it? Anyone?

400
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,915
Step up

401
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,216
No, no, you rip-off!

402
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,250
Step right up

403
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,495
Bottled Water 2,000 Yen

404
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,062
Bottled Water going fast 2,500 Yen

405
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,307
We should have bought the first one!

406
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,243
A little farther, we might find
cheaper water

407
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,911
Or more expensive

408
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,211
Yes, welcome

409
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,544
Oh, nothing...

410
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,051
What will you do?

411
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,325
At the store, it was 500 Yen

412
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,661
No, this is our current price

413
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,792
You'll never sell them at this price

414
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,866
I'll buy them all,
at 600 Yen per bottle

415
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,741
Why did you make red beans and rice?

416
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,043
Why? I just thought...

417
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,719
The celebratory food would give us energy

418
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,650
Don't waste precious food

419
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,168
Where did he go?

420
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,901
Wondering off again

421
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,662
<i>Gross</i>

422
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,199
I'm looking for a bathroom

423
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,956
Don't let anyone pass

424
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,821
Don't look!

425
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,128
My turn, next

429
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,711
Get back! Get back, please!

430
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,749
The planes are not flying!

431
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,482
Get back for your own safety!

432
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,756
Get back! It's dangerous

433
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,755
Get back, get back!

434
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,759
How long will this go on!

435
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,524
The whole Tokyo area is blacked out!

436
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,391
No one knows when it will come back!

437
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,799
<i>We know that!</i>

438
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,803
<i>Hey cop! Do your job!</i>

439
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:32,873
They're useless!
Where's the Self Defense Force!

440
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,770

441
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,535

442
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,346

You need to pay first
30,000 Yen per person

446
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
Yes

447
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,935
There's no water

448
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,496
OK

449
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,908
Oh, good We'll go home tomorrow, right?

450
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,946
What?

451
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,478
What! No!

452
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,952
No way! We're going? To Kagoshima?! By bicycle!

453
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,859
Right, it's our only choice

454
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,123
What!

455
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,786
No way!

456
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,557
You saw it at the airport!

457
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,629
It's dangerous to stay
in a city without food or water

458
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,496
Impossible! I totally refuse!

459
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,540
It's not impossible
That's what they did in the old days

460
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,170
Yaji and Kita walked from Tokyo to Osaka

461
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,213
Who the hell is that! I'm not from the old days!

462
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,156
I had a feeling it would
turn out like this

463
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,183
Then why didn't you say so sooner?

464
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,852
We came so far out of our way!

465
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,592
We had no way of knowing until we got here

466
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,871
Oh...

467
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,872
We need another bicycle

468
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,875
And a map and food and...

469
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,412
Oh, I know!

470
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:58,180

What are you doing?

477
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,307
No matter how fast, it'll take
one month to ride to Kagoshima

478
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,711
What! It's that far?

479
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,319
I just heard someone say

480
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,049
that beyond Osaka, it's not blacked out

481
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,626
ls that true? Who said that?

482
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,326
Someone walking

483
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,429
I told you so Heading west is the right plan

484
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,163
How could that rumor spread here,

485
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,340
all the way from Osaka?

486
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,004
It spreads because it's true

487
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,112

00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,572
So, this is how ii is

555
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,007
What!

556
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,137
I stepped on something!
It's squishy!

557
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,116
There's a dead raccoon right there

558
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,348
Don't step on it

559
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,051
Here we are

560
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,648
Too bad you have to see everything

561
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,228
Thanks for your business

562
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,740
"Day 16"

563
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,701
Oh, no, this is all that's left

564
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,740
What are you whimpering about?

565
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,645
You can light a fire
without matches

566
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,211
How?

567
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,011
Cavemen could do it,
of course we can,too

568
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,777
<i>So, how?</i>

569
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,690
I'll show you when the time comes

570
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,025
Give me water!

571
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,360
That was the last bottle

572
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,464
Why didn't you tell me first!

573
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:02,828
I told you!

574
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,370
You did?
I didn't hear you

575
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,201
Let's <i>go look for some</i> later

576
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,479
We won't find any here

577
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,721
What are you doing?
Can you drink that?

578
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,920
Don't do that

579
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:33,090
See? Look how clear it is

580
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:38,495
You guys are such wimps

581
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,742
Tastes great!

582
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,113
Tasty!

583
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,961
Leave that!

584
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,120
I can't stand it!

585
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,890
Where are you going!

586
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,472
Diarrhea?

587
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,169
He drank that water

588
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,148
Hopeless

589
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,446
Oh, no

590
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,199
I only wore this once

591
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,895
Oh, no

592
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,938
Oh, dear...

593
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,990
What?

594
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,071
Ouch!

595
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,296
Maybe there's food

596
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,059
"Rice Sold Out"

597
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,945
"Tires and Tubes Sold Out"

598
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,054
"No Matches or Lighters"

599
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,492
Where is it?

600
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,158
"Silicon adhesive"

601
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,492
Found it

602
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,036
Hey, hey! Do you think we can eat this?

603
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,304
The Internet says they can tuna
and catfood at the same factory

604
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,972
Really? Maybe we can flavor it and make a soup

605
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,249
We still need water and matches

606
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,387
"Battery Liquid Replenishment"

607
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,753
Don't! Stop!

608
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,087
It's fine, you can drink it

609
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,198
It's fine It's purified water

610
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,505
You're right! But it doesn't taste good

611
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,026
Are you still at it? You should rest

612
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,560
Look at our great haul!

613
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:42,138
There was one smoke candle left

614
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,020
What? Use this to light a fire

615
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,183
"Remove from the..."

616
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,656
That hurt! What are you doing?

617
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,027
Rice cakes

618
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,497
Eat it raw?

619
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,672
But your father...

620
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,071
Look at this

621
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,547
Disgusting!

622
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,069
Are you sure?

623
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,746
"Day 22"

624
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,341
Tastes awful

625
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:10,555
You'd better listen to your mother

626
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,856
Oh, hello

627
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,201
"Shizuoka Prefecture"

628
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,573
Oh, what a great idea!

629
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,515
How are you getting water and food?

630
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,010
<i>Us?</i>

631
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:17,024
When you ride through the mountains,

632
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:20,260
there's water seeping through rocks, right?

633
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:25,391
Moss is proof the water's pure, so we bottle it

634
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:29,959
lf you're worried, you can boil it to disinfect it

635
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:46,251
You should air dry or smoke any food

636
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,913
It lasts longer that way

637
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:53,284
And most weeds that you see are actually edible.
Wait

638
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,324
Weeds like this plantain and dandelion

639
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,901
or weeds with leaves
growing from the earth are fine

640
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:11,637
You can boil them for a soup filled with vitamins

641
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,007
I recommend cicadas

642
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,477
Cicadas?!

643
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:24,357
Don't be so shocked
Locusts have been food for centuries

644
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,356
Insects are quite nutritious

645
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,760
In Africa, everyone eats caterpillars

646
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,356
You just like that stuff

647
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:37,836
Look over here

648
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,341
What? You can take pictures with that camera?

649
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,835
Yeah, but it's not digital
Film was always mechanical

650
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,842
When you print it, please send it

651
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,715
Sure, but...
I have no idea when

652
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:51,613
Please

653
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:52,776
A notepad

654
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,749
I'll write down my address

655
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:59,359
What humans need in order to survive are, first,

656
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,360
to maintain body warmth

657
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,991
Next, secure water and three, start fires

658
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,994
Food is next on the list

659
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,633
Hang in there, go, go

660
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,977
Hang in there

661
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,710
Looking good

662
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,543
Your dad's in the lead

663
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,142
Just ignore him

664
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:28,987
He's fast

665
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,161
This is great

666
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,460
The landscape is so different

667
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,394
The breeze feels great

668
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,520
Hey!

669
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,388
Look at that

670
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,596
Oh, Dear

671
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,940
Excuse me...

672
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:39,490
They came from a nuclear power plant

673
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,620
What's the situation?

674
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,196
They don't know why but it won't turn on

675
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,464
They're going to Shizuoka to inspect another one

676
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,096
ls it true there's power in Osaka?

677
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,508
We don't know that

678
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,574
Even if there's power in Osaka,

679
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,744
we don't have to go there

680
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:07,846
This is how things are,
we might as well enjoy it, right?

681
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,518
That's right

682
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,626
"To Osaka"

683
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:25,995
Take care

684
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:55,531
"Osaka"

685
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:03,966
"Day 43"

686
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,170
"Looking for Abe Takashi"

687
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,593
I've had it!

688
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:26,656
Dad,you said,
"We're only bicycling to Osaka!"

689
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,330
I never said that

690
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:32,571
What will we do?!
We have no food or water!

691
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:36,737
I can't change or bathe and my head itches!

692
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,276
That's not my fault

693
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,672
You never take responsibility!

694
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,615
You said, Follow me and you'll be fine

695
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,843
You did, you liar!

696
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,921
How dare you speak to me like that!

697
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:52,624
Then act like a father!
You talk big, but you're useless

698
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,558
What the hell!

699
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,687
That's enough!

700
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,864
You should have figured that a long time ago!

701
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,927
That's just who your father is!

702
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,411
I'm putting it in

703
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:57,423
Kobe Aquarium

704
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,261
Here comes the fish

705
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,368
It's hot, be careful

706
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,342
- Looks tasty
- Sure does

707
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:32,420
Here you go

708
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:37,658
I'm sorry, we just ran out

709
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,460
Can't you give us some?

710
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,028
- I can pay you money!
- It's all gone

711
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,839
Just enough for the children
Please!

712
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,945
It's all gone

713
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,004
I beg you!

714
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:18,136
"Day 67"

715
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,825
Dear...

716
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,189
Hey!

717
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,382
Wait!

718
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:22,828
Dear!

719
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,061
Yui!

720
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,840
Honey, grab him!

721
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,659
Are you OK, Dad?

722
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:03,965
I did it

723
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:06,998
<i>Oh, good</i>

724
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,873
We did it

725
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,906
Meat

726
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,577
You do it

727
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:23,014
I can't even fillet a fish

728
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:26,984
Can I start anywhere?

729
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,222
Just do it!

730
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,395
What are you doing!

731
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,948
Where are we being taken?

732
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,668
Can you drink the well water?

733
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,477
Of course you can

734
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:09,091
The electric fences on my pig farm
stopped working

735
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,492
and they all ran away

736
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:19,005
I'm sorry we killed one without...

737
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,504
In exchange,

738
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:25,807
if you help me catch the runaway pigs,

739
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,706
I'll forgive you

740
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,311
Will you?

741
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,287
Aren't you hungry?

742
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,717
It's not a free lunch

743
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,718
What's this?

744
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,694
Smoked pork

745
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,825
This is what you do
when you can't use the refrigerator

746
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,382
Why are you crying?

747
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,889
I don't know

748
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,899
Oh

749
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:02,373
My, you have guests

750
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,742
I thought your son's family
came home

751
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,348
You're always so generous

752
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,158
Why just this one pig?

753
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,252
The pigs haven't come back yet?

754
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,723
With their help, I'll get them back

755
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,232
How nice

756
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,770
Young people can do anything

757
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,132
See you

758
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,337
Take one home

759
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,143
This is the last one

760
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,347
Gee, thanks

761
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:54,351
Now, you can start by helping me butcher Hanako

762
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,823
Was that pig's name Hanako?

763
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,359
That was a joke
What pig has a name?

764
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,246
Come over here and help

765
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,173
Open this and spread it!

766
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,314
Here!

767
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,815
Hold it here!

768
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:42,571
Hold it down!

769
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,561
This is a huge job

770
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:12,895
It's tough job alone, but no big deal
with you all here

771
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,512
- Look tasty?
- Yes!

772
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:35,258
If you work hard,
I can share a little with you

773
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,526
You can't eat it right away

774
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:44,566
Have to let it rest underground
before smoking it

775
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,932
Um, how long does it need to rest?

776
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,665
About one week

777
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,404
One week?

778
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,979
You're useless

779
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:36,354
I take the first bath

780
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:37,322
Yes

781
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,031
We're in Okayama

782
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,510
How are the pajamas?

783
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,376
They're perfect

784
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,506
Who do they...

785
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:40,074
I bought them for when my son's family visits

786
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,184
His whole family's in America

787
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,519
Good looking, right?

788
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,193
I don't want to waste the oil

789
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:55,399
Oh, yes

790
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:56,567
<i>Good night</i>

791
01:24:56,724 --> 01:25:00,194
Starting tomorrow, you'll work hard

792
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,408
A futon...

793
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,083
He must be worried

794
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,121
about his grandchildren

795
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:25,464
Right?

796
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,479
Found one
Here we go!

797
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:14,802
Grab it!

798
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,684
Not over there!

799
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:40,772
That's the last one.
Hang in there.

800
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,896
Mom, is this OK?

801
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,235
Looks fine

802
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,544
That's not for smoking

803
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:46,738
If you want, you can just move in

804
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,934
I wish my washing machine
and car would work,

805
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:56,605
but living alone in
these conditions is tough

806
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,719
Will you think about it, please?

807
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,248
I did it!

808
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:14,292
Hey! Shoo!

809
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,100
Get out of here!

810
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,934
His offer is generous,

811
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,736
but we need to get
to your father

812
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:29,713
Let's go to Kagoshima

813
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,311
Do you two agree?

814
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,331
Are you sure you want to give us so much?

815
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,765
You sure helped me out

816
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:57,171
Thank you so much

817
01:28:57,932 --> 01:28:59,639
You take care

818
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,257
Dear, wait!

819
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:56,961
Are you OK, Mitsue?

820
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,134
Hang in there, Mitsue!

821
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:13,884
No way...

822
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,756
What! What?

823
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,794
Why? There is no bridge!

824
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:27,726
We left that road 3 days ago!
Do we have to go all the way back!

825
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:30,233
That map is out of date

826
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,938
Goddammit!

827
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,017
Stop it

828
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:24,788
- Here
- Thanks

829
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:25,916
This way

830
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,115
Are you two going to be OK?

831
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:57,886
You made <i>us</i> take all those swim classes

832
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,551
We'll drop Mom on the other shore

833
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,829
and then Kenji and I will shuttle the bikes over

834
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:16,839
Get on! Get on!

835
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,532
I'll go!

836
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,203
No, stay there!

837
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:14,399
Let's load them all
The river will get too fast

838
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:36,952
- Hold it!
- I'm holding it!

839
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,289
Hold it!

840
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:43,454
The raft broke!

841
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,559
Dad!

842
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:52,464
Kenji!

843
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:14,751
Oh no, Dad!

844
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:16,990
Dad!

845
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,567
Dad!

846
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:24,664
Dad!

847
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,609
Dad!

848
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:51,085
"Day 94"

849
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,294
This way

850
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,957
Come

851
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,556
Stop!

852
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,662
Mom!

853
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:16,457
Mom!

854
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,761
Are you OK?

855
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,309
It's fine, let's go

856
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:08,587
No, I can't

857
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:19,324
<i>From Tokyo to here</i> on <i>bicycles?</i>

858
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:23,460
That's a grueling trip

859
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:28,333
And, where's your father?

860
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:57,610
Stop!

861
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:01,539
We're almost to last big tunnel

862
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:05,943
The Falcon used to run through it

863
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:08,211
ls the Falcon a bullet train?

864
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:09,916
Of course not

865
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,079
Oh, you're awake

866
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:19,090
The Falcon was an express sleeper

867
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,600
In those days, airplane fares were expensive

868
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:24,364
Yes, they were

869
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:28,195
Your mom's parents wouldn't let me marry her

870
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:32,600
So we commuted together
to Kagoshima to ask their permission

871
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,170
Wow

872
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,581
You never told us about that

873
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:14,613
Time to close it

874
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:16,684
Better close the window...

875
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:29,095
What is this! My eyes!

876
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:30,758
The window!

877
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:31,219
"Day 108"

878
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:48,779
<i>Look!</i>

879
01:46:54,775 --> 01:46:56,880
Daddy!

880
01:46:57,043 --> 01:46:57,953
Hey!

881
01:46:58,111 --> 01:47:00,785
Grandpa!

882
01:47:02,048 --> 01:47:04,858
Dad!

883
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:23,779
"2 Years and 126 days later"

884
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,777
All together!

885
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,882
Big haul today

886
01:47:31,311 --> 01:47:33,882
- Give me a hand
- Right away

887
01:47:41,922 --> 01:47:43,868
Keep the threads taut

888
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:48,834
Looking good

889
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:00,282
They're back

890
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,249
We're back!

891
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:06,083
Big haul! Big haul!

892
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:12,828
Lots of great fish

893
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:21,438
Hurry everybody!

894
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:09,945
Oh, Dear

895
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,127
The lights are back on

896
01:50:25,485 --> 01:50:27,465
- They're on!
- They're on!

897
01:51:06,126 --> 01:51:09,471
The sudden global blackout
that started 2.5 years ago,

898
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:12,803
experts now believe was caused by a solar flare,

899
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:15,604
or a comet that came close to Earth

900
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:18,113
It might also have been cyber-terrorism,

901
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,082
aimed at the power grid and power plants

902
01:51:21,207 --> 01:51:23,551
but this has never been proven...

903
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:25,519
...to prove any theories,

904
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:30,128
the blackout stopped all computers and electronics,

905
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:33,687
leaving no records from that time

906
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,999
However, it is important to establish...

907
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:38,135
What's that?

908
01:51:38,324 --> 01:51:40,497
Tonight, I'll cook mackerel

909
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,638
Great!

910
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:44,370
That's so pretty

911
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,305
Right?

912
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:46,775
Looks tasty

913
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:51,140
- I'm off
- I'm off

914
01:51:51,304 --> 01:51:53,375
<i>Off you go</i>

915
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,246
Coming, coming

916
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:03,593
Hello?

917
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:05,995
Wait, wait!

918
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:12,225
What is it?

919
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:15,202
Your father forgot his lunch

920
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:25,681
How could you forget!?

921
01:52:25,872 --> 01:52:27,215
Sorry about that!

922
01:52:29,175 --> 01:52:30,086
Thank you

923
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:31,783
Suzuki san, mail for you

01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:33,716
Thank you so much

925
01:52:35,348 --> 01:52:37,123
I wonder what it is?

926
01:52:39,452 --> 01:52:41,864
